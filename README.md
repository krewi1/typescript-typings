# Typescript types

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/krewi1/typescript-typings.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/krewi1/typescript-typings)

This package tries to aggregate mapped types which i use inside my projects so i dont have to write them again on all places.

If you have any idea for improvements/want to add some typing feel free to create pull request.
